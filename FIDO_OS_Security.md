### Abstract
[cite_start]Popular Consumer Operating Systems on desktop computers such as Windows and MacOS are bundled with weak default security leaving users vulnerable the moment they are powered on[cite: 7]. [cite_start]Mandatory adoption of FIDO keys is the most effective solution to their default single factor password based authentication methods[cite: 8]. [cite_start]This offers built-in three factor authentication, and the potential to introduce device security and SSO to popular and vulnerable internet services[cite: 9]. [cite_start]This is evident when comparing threat vectors with and without FIDO[cite: 10]. [cite_start]In addition, when their use is mandated as the primary authentication method, the FIDO approach overcomes user apathy for improved security, thus universally improving security outcomes[cite: 11].

### I. INTRODUCTION
[cite_start]The convenience of unprecedented access to information and services is costly[cite: 15]. [cite_start]While everyday users increasingly rely on personal computers, opportunities for attackers similarly increase[cite: 16]. [cite_start]Consumer operating systems, like Windows and macOS, are the most common in use today[cite: 17]. [cite_start]But, their default authentication methods remain dependent on weak, legacy practices[cite: 18]. [cite_start]Password-based authentication enables a wide attack surface for adversaries, worsened further by user apathy towards improved security[cite: 19]. [cite_start]Most fail to enable even basic multi-factor authentication (MFA)[cite: 20]. [cite_start]It is clear that consumer OSs must structurally change how authentication occurs[cite: 20].

[cite_start]In this age of continuous internet access, OS designers can no longer share users' apathy toward security[cite: 21]. [cite_start]Optional features should not be option[cite: 22]. [cite_start]This paper theorizes that mandating FIDO2 based USB-C authentication keys, combining biometric verification, hardware possession, and a local PIN, eliminates password-based login on consumer OSs and significantly reduces unauthorized access risk[cite: 22]. [cite_start]By using all three authentication factors in a default flow, this approach closes the security gap without relying on user behavioral change[cite: 23].

[cite_start]Credential-based attacks are mitigated this way[cite: 24]. [cite_start]Section II walks through existing research on threats, user apathy and how OSs fail to address them in the current landscape[cite: 24]. [cite_start]Section III explores the the biometric fido technology, with Section IV demonstrating how it addresses the current security limitations, and reviewing the threat data to measure the effectiveness of the solution against known attack vectors[cite: 25]. [cite_start]Finally, in Section V, we look at the future trajectory of this approach, what success looks like, how to handle duplicate/lost keys, and then discuss the need for abstract layer improvements to enable seamless integration[cite: 26].

### II. RELATED RESEARCH
[cite_start]The three papers presented below contribute to the discourse on authentication practice, neglect, and abuse[cite: 29]. [cite_start]Other industry and non profit publications were also consulted for matters of fact and specification, including those from Verizon (DBIR), Cyber Readiness Institute, Okta, Security Magazine, Bitwarden, CyberNews, Consumer Reports, SC World, Prove Identity, Pew, FIDO, Google, Microsoft, IBM, National Cybersecurity Alliance, and Duo[cite: 30]. [cite_start]Two other scholarly works are also cited[cite: 31]. [cite_start]However, none fully align with our approach requiring a radical shift in OS architectural design[cite: 31, 32].

*Evaluating User Perception of Multi-Factor Authentication: A Systematic Review* by Wang et al. (2019) [cite_start]finds consumers avoid MFA, even knowing the risks instead preferring simple "what you know" authentication vs "what you have"[cite: 33, 34]. [cite_start]While the study briefly acknowledges FIDO as promising, it's focus is enterprise settings[cite: 34]. [cite_start]We argue voluntary MFA adoption is insufficient and propose the complete elimination of passwords for primary authentication, replacing them with mandatory FIDO2-based biometric login requiring the hardware, PIN, and fingerprint for privilege escalation and key unlocking[cite: 35].

*Cyber Security Awareness Campaigns: Why Do They Fail to Change Behaviour?* by Bada et al. (2020) [cite_start]determines users fail to self-improve their own security outcomes, even while understanding the risks, concluding awareness is not enough to change users' behavior[cite: 36, 37]. [cite_start]It is not a technical discussion[cite: 38]. [cite_start]Rather it underscores a critical barrier that this research eliminates[cite: 38]. [cite_start]We do not rely on voluntary participation[cite: 39].

*Is FIDO2 the Kingslayer of User Authentication? A Comparative Usability Study of FIDO2 Passwordless Authentication* by Lyastani et al. (2020) [cite_start]concludes FIDO2 offers advantages and has the potential for user satisfaction, making it a suitable replacement for passwords[cite: 40, 41]. [cite_start]It identifies key loss and recovery concerns vs security gains[cite: 42]. [cite_start]It does not advocate eliminating passwords entirely or mandating hardware-backed authentication as we argue[cite: 43]. [cite_start]We propose addressing the key loss problem through enforced redundancy, easily made available via cloud[cite: 44]. [cite_start]We propose a novel solution for key loss[cite: 45].

### III. MOTIVATING EXAMPLE
[cite_start]Any Consumer OS built primarily for passwords are our motivating examples, and they are many[cite: 48]. [cite_start]The single proposed solution is, in a word, password-less[cite: 49]. [cite_start]Direct, primary FIDO integration into consumer operating systems eliminates the hashed data storage on the operating system for managing passwords[cite: 49]. [cite_start]Instead, everything needed to authenticate the user is stored within a personal portable device[cite: 50]. [cite_start]The biometric approach would store its private key, user defined PIN, and biometric data locally[cite: 50, 51].

[cite_start]It is worth noting that the PIN is not a password in the sense that it is the primary factor stored on the OS[cite: 52]. [cite_start]It is not[cite: 53]. [cite_start]It is simply a secondary factor, along with biometric data based on the user's fingerprint, that re-enforces the primary factor the key itself[cite: 53]. [cite_start]This represents a radical shift in how OSs are designed[cite: 54]. [cite_start]Often the first operation a user performs upon initial boot of a new or restored device is selecting a password[cite: 55]. [cite_start]Historically, this has been a routine, primary function[cite: 56]. [cite_start]This model, along with its assumptions and prejudices, must end[cite: 56].

[cite_start]Most devices on the market today support at least one type of USB port[cite: 57]. [cite_start]This enables universal compatibility with OS underlying albeit optional features that support the technology[cite: 58]. [cite_start]The declining cost of the hardware brings the technology into common availability, providing users with a bring-your-own-key option assuming that a password-less future won't require PC manufacturers to provide them, incorporating the cost into their MSRPs[cite: 59]. [cite_start]This and other proposed directions, and their challenges, are discussed further in section V[cite: 60].

### IV. HYPOTHESIS AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE
[cite_start]Mandatory FIDO based keys, incorporating three authentication factors, are effective mitigating consumer Operating Systems' (Windows and MacOS) single factor, password-only (weak) security[cite: 63]. [cite_start]The approach supersedes inherent resistance to adoption while universally improving data security outcomes[cite: 64]. [cite_start]This assertion is based on careful examination of existing scholarship on user attitudes and behaviors, the features of available technologies, the technical specifications and use cases for FIDO keys, the established default, and unfortunately preferred, authentication method of the subject OSs (passwords), and finally by comparing Threat Vectors prior to and following implementation of the proposed solution[cite: 65].

[cite_start]The threat vector analysis is conclusive as demonstrated in the evidence, data, and charts discussed[cite: 66]. [cite_start]Following this approach, it is clear that threats to systems that depend solely on weak, reused, easily guessed or brute forced, or potentially leaked credentials are largely mitigated by incorporating FIDO keys as the mandated, primary authentication method[cite: 67].

[cite_start]It is important first to understand that, as discussed in section II, there exists user apathy adopting security improvements[cite: 68]. [cite_start]Users chose convenience and familiarity versus the inconvenience of the simple multi-factor approaches commonly used in enterprise settings with their own devices even knowing the risks[cite: 69]. [cite_start]The Verizon DBIR states that nearly half of breaches resulted from unauthorized use of actual credentials[cite: 70]. [cite_start]The risk to credentials results from users abusing their own passwords, often reusing weak passwords and or failing to periodically recycle as is commonplace in enterprise settings which also results in the continuing effectiveness of using credentials already leaked or stolen[cite: 71].

[cite_start]Therefore, mandatory adoption by OS designers of a hardware token to interact with existing authentication frameworks, rather than ongoing dependence on keyboard and hash of a stored string, represents the secured future of consumer operating systems[cite: 72]. [cite_start]Enterprises have long adopted approaches to combating weak passwords and mandating MFA[cite: 73, 74]. [cite_start]Increasingly FIDO keys, in various forms and feature adoption, are establishing in the business world but not yet on a similar scale in consumer markets[cite: 74]. [cite_start]The opportunity for biometric-based FIDO keys to close the known vulnerabilities of single factor password use and abuse is available[cite: 75]. [cite_start]They are known to be phishing resistant, relatively easy to use, uses an industry standard port, are becoming more cost attractive, and simultaneously employ three factors (have, know, are) on the models with biometrics[cite: 76].

[cite_start]Since FIDO stores no credentials on the OS, therefore, Offline, Token Theft, and Replays are eliminated[cite: 90]. [cite_start]Key and Screen capture are eliminated as risks because auth is cryptographic and secrets are not transmitted[cite: 91]. [cite_start]Brute Force and Credential Stuffing/Guessing are also eliminated because attacker would need the key and factors[cite: 92]. [cite_start]The remaining vectors are also applicable but more so in a remote context[cite: 93]. [cite_start]Generally, the password-less, multi factor nature of FIDO effectively challenges all applicable attack vectors but leaves token theft as a consequence but largely mitigated risk due to multi factor[cite: 94].

### V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
[cite_start]Lyastani et al cites key loss as "a predominant concern" of end users[cite: 97]. [cite_start]Still much work needs to be done to address this and other challenges to bridge the gap to an actual password-less reality[cite: 98]. [cite_start]Duplicates is the obvious solution[cite: 99]. [cite_start]But in the password-less future we advocate for, users need a secure way to recover lost keys[cite: 99]. [cite_start]Such a solution should be fast and self-service[cite: 100]. [cite_start]There also needs to be a secure way to backup keys in such a way that only the authorized owner can access the data[cite: 100]. [cite_start]And there are already parts of a robust solution available[cite: 101]. [cite_start]Datashur and others manufacture FIPS compliance USB devices that require a personal PIN to access[cite: 102]. [cite_start]What if such a device were secured in a safe place to be used only for recovery scenarios[cite: 103]? [cite_start]Moreover, what if this device was needed to actually "mint" a replacement key from a cloud backup using a blank key and their existing device[cite: 104]? [cite_start]The "module" would encrypt the transfer (of the already encrypted backup) and manage the duplication process[cite: 105].

[cite_start]The dynamics must be further considered[cite: 106]. [cite_start]Cloud will play some role, but in this future, such a device will be a necessity[cite: 106]. [cite_start]There are challenges advancing the FIDO protocol into its own universal application standardizing the user experience across all devices[cite: 107, 108]. [cite_start]Such a standardized front end would replace Windows Hello or similar tools on other OSs[cite: 109]. [cite_start]This approach not only will change device authentication but as the potential to change how we access remote websites by adding our commonly used devices as part of the authentication process, an advanced SSO that also evaluates your device and whether you used a token to sign[cite: 110]. [cite_start]This has the potential to change how we use internet services as well[cite: 111]. [cite_start]The goal is clear[cite: 112]. [cite_start]The approach discussed here is highly secure, technically and practically available[cite: 112]. [cite_start]Enterprise quality security must come home[cite: 113].
